Zsound is built to support r38 and r39 in a single .lib file.

The assembly include files each begin with a directive to define
REV=39 (I tend to use 39 by default). You can override this
by specifying --asm-define REV=xx (currently 38 or 39) when
building a source file which includes functions from zsound.

e.g.:
cl65 -t cx16 --asm-define REV=38 -o REV38.PRG myprogram.asm zsound.lib
cl65 -t cx16 --asm-define REV=39 -o REV39.PRG myprogram.asm zsound.lib

This allows projects to be built for R38 or R39 without
having to re-compile zsound.lib for that particular revision.

Whenever R39 is made official, this functionality will be removed
and zsound will thereafter require R39.


REVS VS. ZSM FILES:

One key item that differs between R38 and R39 is the clock speed
of the YM2151 chip. As of R39 (and on the real hardware), the
YM2151 is clocked at 3.5MHz which is the reference value given by
Yamaha. Earlier revs used 4MHz. This alters the pitch of the sound
it produces. Therefore, you will find many examples where the music
files exist as BGM38.ZSM and BGM39.ZSM

ZSM itself is compatible with either revision, but since the tuning
differs, I have created ZSM files tailored to each revision so that
the pitch is correct. This is particularly important for music which
uses both the YM and the VERA PSG, as the PSG does NOT change pitch
between R38 and R39. Thus, out-of-tune FM voices are quite jarring.

The VGM2ZSM tool allows you to specify which revision it should
tune its output for. By default, it uses the correct 3.5MHz tuning.
To make a ZSM file tuned for R38, use command line option -4 to
specify 4MHz clocking.

e.g.:
vgm2zsm -4 rastan.vgm RASTAN.ZSM

I had considered making the library perform this pitch alteration
during runtime in order to eliminate the need for keeping multiple
music versions around. However, since R38 should be going away in
the future, I feel it is better to keep the code smaller and faster.

You will see in the example programs that my solution is to simply
use a conditional branch in the code where file names are specified.

.if REV=38
filename: .byte "bgm38.zsm"
.else
filename: .byte "bgm39.zsm"
.endif
